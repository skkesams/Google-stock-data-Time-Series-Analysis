# Google-stock-data-Time-Series-Analysis

In this project I have done time series analysis on Google stock data with following steps:
- First I found out the p-value to check if that series is Non-Stationary/Stationary. 
- To convert Non stationary series into stationary I used differencing technique.
- Implemented Arima and Seasonal Arima models on the processed dataset.
- Able to calculate Mean Absolute Error Percentage for both the models.
